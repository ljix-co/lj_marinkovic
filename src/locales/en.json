The boundaries of space and time are crossed each day, physically and through the online network. The contemporary artist is a part of that society.

For the creation of the artworks, the process is no longer important, but the base in the idea and the outcome. Variations on the subject could be observed in the final results, and my subject is the social status of an ordinary, contemporary human.",

Design should be adjusted to the needs of the client and the user so that it could represent the client and its business in the best possible way, thereby functionalities and access to the information should remain intuitive for the user.
