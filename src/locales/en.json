The boundaries of space and time are crossed each day, physically and through the online network. The contemporary artist is a part of that society. One media could not satisfy the artist or his audience. Creative curiosity forces us to experiment and by it to move boundaries. For the creation of the artworks, the process is no longer important, but the base in the idea and the outcome. Variations on the subject could be observed in the final results, and my subject is the social status of an ordinary, contemporary human.",
